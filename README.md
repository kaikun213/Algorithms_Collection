## Basic Algorithms repo for "Analysis and design of Algorithms"

Additional to coursework.
All algorithms learned in 3711H written into python code.

Sorted after topic and problem. Intended to be documented well for understanding.

*Note: The algorithms might not be tested well and it is more for understanding then for actual correctness*

* [x] marks already programmed algorithms
* (H) means it was covered in homework
* (T) means it was covered in tutorial
* Additional material usually describes more theoretical topics covered * that can hardly be written in code.
